  # Style Guidelines: Markdown

  This document contains formatting standards for creating readable, consistent
  files using Markdown.

  One problem I run into constantly when creating Markdown files is that I waste
  an ass-load of time fiddling with how the text looks before it gets parsed.
  Then, after I'm finished writing, I waste even more time adjusting what looks
  good in my text editor so that it looks good in a browser or Markdown viewer.

  Being a masochist, I of course decided to create a guideline I could follow
  which would produce decent looking output without looking stupid in vim.

  ## Basic conventions for Markdown files

    * Wrap all lines at 80 characters.
    * Denote **bold** text using the asterisk format: `**bold text**`.
    * Denote _italic_ text using the underscore format: `_emphasized text_`.
    * Force a linebreak by ending a line with two spaces, no more.

  ## Headings

    * Header text must use the `atx-style` with no closing `#` character.
    * Include a space between the `#` and the text of the Header
    * Headers spanning more than 80 characters should be re-evaluated.
    * Headers must be preceded and followed by a newline except at the beginning
      of a file.

  ## Lists

    * **List items** must be indented 2 spaces further than their parent.

    * The first level of list items must not be preceded by a newline.
    * All lists must be followed by newlines.
    * List item lines exceeding 80 characters should, when wrapped, align
      vertically with the beginning of the preceding line's text.

  ## Tables

  Like fenced code blocks, tables in Markdown are provided by Markdown Extra
  which seems to be pretty widely implemented.

    * Pipe characters must be preceded and followed by spaces for readability.
    * Table column width should be determined by the longest cell in the column.
    * Always format tables so they are readable in pre-processing.
    * Tables must always be preceded and followed by newlines.

  ### Table example:

  _A handsome table in pre-processed markdown is also handsome when rendered:_

  Vana'diel Chocobo Society | Chocobo Raising | FFXI:TOAU
