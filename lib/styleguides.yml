  This document contains formatting standards for creating readable, consistent
  files using Markdown.

  One problem I run into constantly when creating Markdown files is that I waste
  an ass-load of time fiddling with how the text looks before it gets parsed.
  Then, after I'm finished writing, I waste even more time adjusting what looks
  good in my text editor so that it looks good in a browser or Markdown viewer.

  Being a masochist, I of course decided to create a guideline I could follow
  which would produce decent looking output without looking stupid in vim.

  ## Basic conventions for Markdown files

  You should:

    * wrap all lines at 80 characters
    * make **bold** text using the asterisk format: `**bold text**`
    * make _italic_ text using the underscore format: `_emphasized text_`
    * force a linebreak by ending a line with 2 spaces, no more

  ## Headings

  Header text must use the `atx-style` with no closing `#` character.

  Include a space between the `#` and the text of the Header.

  You shouldn’t use a header that has more than 80 characters.

  You must put a new line before and after a Header except at the beginning of a file.

  ## Lists

  When using lists, you must:

    * indent list items 2 spaces further than their parent
    * put a newline after all lists
    * make sure list item lines more than 80 characters should, when wrapped, align
      vertically with the beginning of the preceding line's text

  ^Don’t put the 1st level of list items immediately after a new line.^


  ## Tables

  Like fenced code blocks, tables in Markdown are provided by Markdown Extra
  which seems to be pretty widely implemented.

  Make sure that:

    * pipe characters are preceded and followed by spaces for readability
    * the table column width is determined by the longest cell in the column
    * the tables are formatted so they’re readable in pre-processing
    * the tables always be preceded and followed by newlines

  ### Table example

  A handsome table in pre-processed markdown is also handsome when rendered:

  Food                      | Kind            | Tasty?
  ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
  Bananas                   | Fruit           | Yes
  Aubergines                | Vegetable       | No
  Apricots                  | Fruit           | Yes
